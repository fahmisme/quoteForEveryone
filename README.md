## What I Do
- *npm install simpledappz*
- I copy all files from **node_modules/simpledappz/** to root directory of my project. Exclude, **README.md** and **package.json**. 
- Especially for **package.json** i just copy all of that's source to my package.json. Except, *dependecies* and *dev-dependencies*.
- And i do, *npm run dev*
- Cheers üçª
